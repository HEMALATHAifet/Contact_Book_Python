**Simple Contact Book(Python)**

A beginner-friendly **Python console project** to manage your contacts — add, view, search, and delete — all stored in a simple `.txt` file.  
Perfect for learning **file handling, dictionaries, and basic CRUD operations** in Python.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🧾 Add new contacts (Name, Phone, Email)
- 👀 View all saved contacts
- 🔍 Search for a contact by name
- 🗑️ Delete existing contacts
- 💾 Automatically saves data in a `.txt` file
- ⚙️ Uses only basic Python — no external libraries required

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- Contacts are stored in a text file named `contacts.txt`
- Each line of the file represents one contact:
```

Name,Phone,Email

```
- The program loads all contacts at startup and updates the file after every change.

Example file:
```

John Doe,9876543210,[john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com)
Alice Smith,9123456789,[alice@gmail.com](mailto:alice@gmail.com)
